# Fashion-MNIST-Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-CNN-
Fashion-MNIST Image Classification is a deep learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify grayscale images of clothing items such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, and shoes. It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **deep learning model to classify fashion apparel images** using the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**.  
The dataset contains grayscale images of clothing items such as **T-shirts, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots**.

The goal is to develop an **image classification pipeline** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to accurately predict the clothing category from image pixel data.
